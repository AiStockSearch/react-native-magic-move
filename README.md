# react-native-magic-move

WIP

## Disclaimer 🐰🎩

Magic-move creates an illusion of transitioning/morphing components from one scene to another. _It however doesn't actually move components to different scenes._ As with real magic tricks, there will be situations where the illusion will not work for you. And as with magic tricks, you may need to **"set the stage"** (e.g. change some stuff in your app) to create a compelling transition. So now that you've received this reality check ✅, go forth and create some bad-ass illusions. Drop me a note of the cool stuff you've built with it. Your grand wizard, IjzerenHein
