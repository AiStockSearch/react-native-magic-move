## Disclaimer üê∞üé©

Magic-move creates the illusion of transitioning/morphing components from one scene to another. _It however doesn't actually move components to different scenes._ As with real magic tricks, there will be situations where the illusion will not work for you. And as with magic tricks, you may need to **"set the stage"** (e.g. change some stuff in your app) to create the transition that you want. So now that you've received this reality check ‚úÖ, go forth and create some bad-ass illusions. Drop me a note of the cool stuff you've built with it. Grand wizard, IjzerenHein
